## Project Overview

Amazon sellers operate in a highly competitive environment where revenue performance is influenced by product mix, customer behavior, and fulfillment efficiency. Order cancellations and regional demand variation can significantly impact realized revenue.

The objective of this analysis is to evaluate sales performance, quantify revenue loss due to cancellations, and identify category- and region-level opportunities to improve net revenue and operational decision-making.

The analysis is based on cleaned Amazon sales transaction data and examines trends across time, product categories, order status, and geography.

Executive Snapshot
	•	Net revenue after cancellations: ₹6.95 Cr
	•	Revenue loss from cancellations and returns: ₹64.6 lakh
	•	Set category contributes the highest revenue but also shows elevated cancellation risk
	•	Maharashtra leads sales performance, highlighting opportunities for region-specific optimization

## Buisness Qustions  

 ## A.Overall Sales Performance
 Q1. What is the total revenue and how does it trend over time?

Key Finding -
Total net revenue after cancellations is ₹6.95 Cr. Revenue peaked in April (₹2.59 Cr) and declined to ₹1.98 Cr by June, a drop of approximately 23%.

Interpretation -
The consistent month-on-month decline indicates either seasonal demand drop, increasing cancellations, or weaker repeat purchases toward Q2.

Business Action -
The business should introduce mid-quarter promotions and closely monitor cancellation drivers starting May to prevent prolonged revenue decline.

## B. Category Performance
Q2. Which product categories generate the highest revenue? 

Key Finding -
The Set category contributes approximately 49% of total revenue, making it the primary revenue driver. Kurta and Western Dress follow at a significantly lower contribution.

Interpretation -
Revenue concentration in a single category increases business risk, especially if that category underperforms or faces supply issues.

Business Action -
While Set should remain a priority category, the business should diversify revenue streams by strengthening Kurta and Western Dress offerings.

## C. Order Status Impact
 Q.3 How do order statuses (Shipped vs Cancelled) impact total revenue?

Key Finding -
Gross order value before cancellations was ₹7.59 Cr, while net realized revenue dropped to ₹6.95 Cr, resulting in a revenue loss of ₹64.6 lakh.

Interpretation -
Nearly 8.5% of potential revenue is lost due to cancellations and returns, directly impacting profitability without generating value.

Business Action -
Even a 2% reduction in cancellation rate could recover an estimated ₹14–15 lakh in revenue, making cancellation control a high-impact focus area.

## D. Cancellation Analysis

Q.4 Which categories have the highest cancellation rates?

Key Finding -
The Set category shows the highest cancellation rate (14.59%), despite being the top revenue contributor.

Interpretation -
This indicates that high sales volume is masking underlying issues such as size mismatch, product expectations, or delivery delays.

Business Action -
Improving product descriptions, size charts, and delivery timelines in the Set category could significantly reduce cancellations without affecting demand.

## E. Geographic Performance


Q.5 Which top 10 states contribute the most to revenue and total orders?

Key Finding -
Maharashtra leads with ₹1.22 Cr revenue from 22,259 orders, while Haryana generates ₹26.5 lakh from 4,415 orders.

Interpretation -
Maharashtra represents a mature, high-volume market, whereas Haryana appears more price-sensitive, with lower revenue per order.

Business Action -
The business should focus retention and upsell strategies in Maharashtra, while using targeted pricing or regional offers to improve Haryana’s revenue efficiency.

## F. Average Order Value (AOV)

Q.6 How does average order value vary by category and state?

Key Finding -
Ethnic Dresses have the highest AOV (₹927), while Tops show the lowest AOV (₹672).

Interpretation -
High-AOV categories indicate premium customer willingness, even if order volume is lower.

Business Action
Premium categories should receive brand-focused marketing, while low-AOV categories can be bundled or promoted to increase basket size.
