## 🔬 Analysis

Business Problem

Amazon sellers deal with large volumes of transactional data but often lack clarity on:
	•	Which product categories generate the highest revenue?
	•	Which products contribute most to overall sales performance?
	•	How do sales trends vary over time?
	•	Where should the seller focus inventory and marketing efforts?

This project aims to answer these questions using historical sales data.

Data Cleaning & Preparation (Excel)

The dataset was cleaned and prepared using standard Excel best practices:
	•	Removed duplicate transaction records
	•	Handled missing/null values
	•	Standardized date formats
	•	Corrected inconsistent category and product naming
	•	Converted raw data into structured tables for analysis

These steps ensured accuracy and reliability before performing any analysis.
