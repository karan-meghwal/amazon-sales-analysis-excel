Project Overview

This project analyzes Amazon sales data to evaluate product performance, revenue trends, and category-level profitability. The objective is to transform raw transactional data into actionable business insights that support data-driven decision-making for an Amazon seller.

The analysis was performed entirely in Microsoft Excel, using structured data cleaning, pivot tables, and dashboard-style summaries.

BEFORE ANALYSIS , WE NEED TO CLEAN DATA 

Data Cleaning & Preparation (Excel)

The dataset was cleaned and prepared using standard Excel best practices:
	•	Removed duplicate transaction records
	•	Handled missing/null values
	•	Standardized date formats
	•	Corrected inconsistent category and product naming
	•	Converted raw data into structured tables for analysis

These steps ensured accuracy and reliability before performing any analysis.

## BUISNESS QUSTIONS  

 ## A. Overall Sales Performance
 Q1. What is the total revenue and how does it trend over time?

Key Finding -
Total net revenue after cancellations is ₹6.95 Cr. Revenue peaked in April (₹2.59 Cr) and declined to ₹1.98 Cr by June, a drop of approximately 23%.

Interpretation -
The consistent month-on-month decline indicates either seasonal demand drop, increasing cancellations, or weaker repeat purchases toward Q2.

Business Action -
The business should introduce mid-quarter promotions and closely monitor cancellation drivers starting May to prevent prolonged revenue decline.

## B. Category Performance
Q2. Which product categories generate the highest revenue? 

Key Finding -
The Set category contributes approximately 49% of total revenue, making it the primary revenue driver. Kurta and Western Dress follow at a significantly lower contribution.

Interpretation -
Revenue concentration in a single category increases business risk, especially if that category underperforms or faces supply issues.

Business Action -
While Set should remain a priority category, the business should diversify revenue streams by strengthening Kurta and Western Dress offerings.

## C. Order Status Impact
 Q.3 How do order statuses (Shipped vs Cancelled) impact total revenue?

Key Finding -
Gross order value before cancellations was ₹7.59 Cr, while net realized revenue dropped to ₹6.95 Cr, resulting in a revenue loss of ₹64.6 lakh.

Interpretation -
Nearly 8.5% of potential revenue is lost due to cancellations and returns, directly impacting profitability without generating value.

Business Action -
Even a 2% reduction in cancellation rate could recover an estimated ₹14–15 lakh in revenue, making cancellation control a high-impact focus area.

## D. Cancellation Analysis

Q.4 Which categories have the highest cancellation rates?

Key Finding -
The Set category shows the highest cancellation rate (14.59%), despite being the top revenue contributor.

Interpretation -
This indicates that high sales volume is masking underlying issues such as size mismatch, product expectations, or delivery delays.

Business Action -
Improving product descriptions, size charts, and delivery timelines in the Set category could significantly reduce cancellations without affecting demand.

## E. Geographic Performance


Q.5 Which top 10 states contribute the most to revenue and total orders?

Key Finding -
Maharashtra leads with ₹1.22 Cr revenue from 22,259 orders, while Haryana generates ₹26.5 lakh from 4,415 orders.

Interpretation -
Maharashtra represents a mature, high-volume market, whereas Haryana appears more price-sensitive, with lower revenue per order.

Business Action -
The business should focus retention and upsell strategies in Maharashtra, while using targeted pricing or regional offers to improve Haryana’s revenue efficiency.

## F. Average Order Value (AOV)

Q.6 How does average order value vary by category and state?

Key Finding -
Ethnic Dresses have the highest AOV (₹927), while Tops show the lowest AOV (₹672).

Interpretation -
High-AOV categories indicate premium customer willingness, even if order volume is lower.

Business Action
Premium categories should receive brand-focused marketing, while low-AOV categories can be bundled or promoted to increase basket size.
